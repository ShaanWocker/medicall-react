              Medi Call offers two very different but complementary services
              focused on independent representation. We offer Independent Scheme
              Management Services to Restricted Medical Schemes and Independent
              Member Care Line Services to select Healthcare Consultants.
            </p>
            <p>
              We deliver continued value and improvement through our independent
              analysis & reporting of trends to our clients.
